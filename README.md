# Readme

This application is being developed for free, convenient, safe, and fun gameplay. I want to make the app as user-friendly and useful as possible, in contrast to all those expensive virtual tabletops.

For now, only a client-server architecture is planned, but in the future, the development of a local server with limited functionality is likely, aiming to create a more grounded version for games.

The main idea of the application is "All in one, and all together." According to the concept plan, games and game rooms should be fully compatible with the content from the library of game elements, and the library of game elements will include all content from gaming systems. At the moment, the concept is under development. Some content is being added, while some is being removed.

Stay tuned for updates.
